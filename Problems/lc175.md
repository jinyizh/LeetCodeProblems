# 175. Combine Two Tables (E)
Table: ``Person``
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key column for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
```
Table: ``Address``
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
```
Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the ``Person`` table. If the address of a ``personId`` is not present in the ``Address`` table, report ``null`` instead.

Return the result table in **any order**.

## MySQL
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Address
ON Person.PersonID = Address.PersonID;
```
Note: Using the ``WHERE`` clause to filter the records will fail if there is no address information for a person because it will not display the name information.
