In SQL, (player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```

Find the **first login date** for each player.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

```

Output: 
+-----------+-------------+

+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |

```

## MySQL
```sql
SELECT A.player_id, MIN(A.event_date) AS first_login
FROM Activity A GROUP BY A.player_id;
```

The ``MIN()`` aggregate function is used to scan every event_date **subgroup** value for each group to find the smallest one.
