# 70. Climbing Stairs (E)
You are climbing a staircase. It takes ``n`` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb ``1`` or ``2`` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Solution 1
```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
        assert (n != 0);
        int[] ret = new int[n + 1]; // ret[0] means ways to get to 0th step -- it should be 0
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i < 3) ret[i] = i;
            else ret[i] = ret[i - 1] + ret[i - 2];
        }
        return ret[n];
    }
```
## Solution 2
```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int right = 1, left = 1, temp = 0; // backwards (right to left) from the last step
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            temp = left;
            left += right;
            right = temp; 
        }
        return left;
    }
```

Thoughts: two ways to **directly** go to p(x) without touching other p is:

- go from p(x - 2)
- go from p(x - 1)

Therefore f(p(x)) = f(p(x - 1)) + f(p(x - 2))
