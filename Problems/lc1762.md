# 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View (M)
There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (**0-indexed**) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

**Example 1**:

**Input**: `heights = [4,2,3,1]`

**Output**: `[0,2,3]`

**Explanation**: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.

## My first solution using stack
```java
public int[] findBuildings(int[] heights) {
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    int current = heights.length - 1;
    ArrayList<Integer> buildingsAL = new ArrayList<>(); // bldgs w/ view
    while (current >= 0) {
        if (!stack.empty()) {
            if (heights[current] > heights[stack.peek()]) 
                stack.push(current);
        }
        else stack.push(current); // right-most bldg
        current--;
    }
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) buildingsAL.add(stack.pop());
    // ArrayList<Integer> -> int[]
    int[] buildings = new int[buildingsAL.size()];
    for (int i=0; i < buildings.length; i++) 
        buildings[i] = buildingsAL.get(i).intValue();
    return buildings;
}
```
