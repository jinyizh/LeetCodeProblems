# 1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue (H)

There are `n` people standing in a queue, and they numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in left to right order. You are given an array heights of distinct integers where `heights[i]` represents the height of the ith person.

A person can see another person to their right in the queue if everybody in between is shorter than both of them. More formally, the ith person can see the jth person if `i < j` and `min(heights[i], heights[j]) > max(heights[i+1], heights[i+2], ..., heights[j-1])`.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the **number of people** the `i`<sup>th</sup> person can see to their right in the queue.

**Example 1**:

**Input**: `heights = [10,6,8,5,11,9]`

**Output**: `[3,1,2,1,1,0]`

## Stack
```java
public int[] canSeePersonsCount(int[] heights) {
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    int[] ans = new int[heights.length];

    for (int i = heights.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            stack.push(heights[i]);
            ans[i] = 0;
            continue;
        }
        int count = 0;
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            int rightHeight = stack.pop();
            count++;
            if (heights[i] < rightHeight) {
                stack.push(rightHeight);
                break;
            }
        }
        ans[i] = count;
        stack.push(heights[i]);
    }

    return ans;
}
