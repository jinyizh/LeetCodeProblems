# 11. Container With Most Water (M)
You are given an integer array height of length ``n``. There are ``n`` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ``i``th line are ``(i, 0)`` and ``(i, height[i])``.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the *maximum amount of water a container can store*.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

```java
public int maxArea(int[] height) {
    int left = 0, right = height.length - 1; 
    int area = 0, res = 0;
    while (left < right) {
        int h = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
        int b = right - left;
        area = h * b;
        res = Math.max(res, area);
        if (height[left] < height[right]) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return res;
}
