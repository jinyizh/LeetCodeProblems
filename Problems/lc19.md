*Hint: Maintain two pointers and update one with a delay of ``n`` steps.*
## C++
```cpp
ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
    auto dummy = new ListNode();
    dummy->next = head;
    auto fast = dummy, slow = dummy;

    while (n--) // runs the loop until n is 0 (false)
        fast = fast->next;
        
    while (fast->next) {
        fast = fast->next;
        slow = slow->next;
    }

    // deletes the node
    auto node = slow->next;
    slow->next = node->next;
    delete node;

    return dummy->next;
}
```
