# 739. Daily Temperatures (M)
Given an array of integers ```temperatures``` represents the daily temperatures, return an array ```answer``` such that ```answer[i]``` is the number of days you have to wait after the ```i```$^{th}$ day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep ```answer[i] == 0``` instead.

## Monotonic Stack
```java
public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
    int n = temperatures.length;
    int[] answer = new int[n];
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    for (int currDay = 0; currDay < n; currDay++) {
        int currentTemp = temperatures[currDay];
        // Pop until the current day's temperature is not
        // warmer than the temperature at the top of the stack
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && temperatures[stack.peek()] < currentTemp) {
            int prevDay = stack.pop();
            answer[prevDay] = currDay - prevDay;
        }
        stack.push(currDay);
    }
    return answer;
}
```
Time complexity and space complexity: O(N).

## Array
```java
public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
    int n = temperatures.length;
    int hottest = Integer.min_value;
    int answer[] = new int[n];
    for (int currDay = n - 1; currDay >= 0; currDay--) {
        int currentTemp = temperatures[currDay];
        if (currentTemp >= hottest) {
            hottest = currentTemp;
            continue;
        }
        int days = 1;
        while (temperatures[currDay + days] <= currentTemp) {
            // Use information from answer to search for the next warmer day
            days += answer[currDay + days];
        }
        answer[currDay] = days;
    }
    return answer;
}
```
Time complexity: O(N).

Space complexity: O(1).
