# 682. Baseball Game (E)

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the `i`<sup>th</sup> operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

- An integer `x`.
  - Record a new score of `x`.
- `'+'`.
  - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
- `'D'`.
  - Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
- `'C'`.
  - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return *the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations*.

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a **32-bit** integer and that all operations are valid.

## Stack
```java
public int calPoints(String[] operations) {
    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    int total = 0;
    for (String operation: operations) {
        if (operation.equals("+")) {
            int top = stack.pop();
            int newScore = top + stack.peek();
            stack.push(top); // have to pop and push again
            stack.push(newScore);
            total += newScore;
        } 
        else if (operation.equals("D")) {
            stack.push(stack.peek() * 2);
            total += stack.peek();
        } 
        else if (operation.equals("C")) {
            total -= stack.pop();
        } 
        else { // operation is a score
            int val = Integer.valueOf(operation);
            stack.push(val);
            total += val;
        }
    }
    return total;
}
```
