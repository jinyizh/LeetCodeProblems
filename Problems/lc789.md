# 789. Escape The Ghosts (M)
You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point ``[0, 0]``, and you are given a destination point ``target = [xtarget, ytarget]`` that you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as a 2D array ghosts, where ``ghosts[i] = [xi, yi]`` represents the starting position of the ith ghost. All inputs are integral coordinates.

Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either move **1 unit** in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west, or stay still. All actions happen simultaneously.

You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) **at the same time** as a ghost, it does not count as an escape.

Return true if it is possible to escape *regardless of how the ghosts move*, otherwise return false.

## Manhattan geometry
The shortest path here is the Manhattan geometry instead of Euclidean geometry. You can escape as long as your Manhattan geometry is shorter than any of the ghosts'.
```cpp
bool escapeGhosts(vector<vector<int>>& ghosts, vector<int>& target) {
    int dist = abs(target[0]) + abs(target[1]); // 0 for x, 1 for y
    for (auto ghost: ghosts) { // dist1 for the ghosts, dist for the player
        int dist1 = abs(ghost[0] - target[0]) + abs(ghost[1] - target[1]);
        if (dist1 <= dist) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

```elixir
defmodule Solution do
  @spec escape_ghosts(ghosts :: [[integer]], target :: [integer]) :: boolean
  def escape_ghosts(ghosts, target) do
    [x, y] = target
    gmin = ghosts |> Enum.map(fn [x1, y1] -> abs(x - x1) + abs(y - y1) end) |> Enum.min()
    abs(x) + abs(y) < gmin
  end
end
```
