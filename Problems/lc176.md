# 176. Second Highest Salary (M)
Table: ``Employee``
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
```
Find the second highest salary from the ``Employee`` table. If there is no second highest salary, return ``null``.
## MySQL
```sql
SELECT (
  SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee
  ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```
Using only the query inside the parentheses can be wrong (will result in an empty table) if there is only one salary in the table.
