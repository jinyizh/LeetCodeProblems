# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately (E)
You are given two strings ``word1`` and ``word2``. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with ``word1``. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example:
```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
```

## Two Pointers
```java
public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
    StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
    int i = 0, j = 0;

    while (i < word1.length() || j < word2.length()) {
        if (i < word1.length()) res.append(word1.charAt(i++));
        if (j < word2.length()) res.append(word2.charAt(j++));
    }
    
    return res.toString();
}
```
