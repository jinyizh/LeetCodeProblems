# 2361. Minimum Costs Using the Train Line
A train line going through a city has two routes, the regular route and the express route. Both routes go through the same ```n + 1``` stops labeled from ```0``` to ```n```. Initially, you start on the regular route at stop ```0```.

You are given two **1-indexed** integer arrays regular and express, both of length ```n```. ```regular[i]``` describes the cost it takes to go from stop ```i - 1``` to stop ```i``` using the regular route, and ```express[i]``` describes the cost it takes to go from stop ```i - 1``` to stop ```i``` using the express route.

You are also given an integer ```expressCost``` which represents the cost to transfer from the regular route to the express route.

Note that:

- There is no cost to transfer from the express route back to the regular route.
- You pay ```expressCost``` every time you transfer from the regular route to the express route.
- There is no extra cost to stay on the express route.

Return a **1-indexed** array ```costs``` of length ```n```, where ```costs[i]``` is the minimum cost to reach stop ```i``` from stop ```0```.

Note that a stop can be counted as reached from either route.

*(My note: visualize the arrays and you will find out that this is a super easy problem)*
```java
public long[] minimumCosts(int[] regular, int[] express, int expressCost) {
        long[] costs = new long[regular.length];
        long reg = 0, exp = expressCost; // init; cost by reg & exp, respectively
        for(int i = 1; i <= regular.length; i++) {
            reg += regular[i - 1]; // cost by reg increases
            exp += express[i - 1]; // cost by exp increases
            reg = Math.min(reg, exp);
            exp = Math.min(exp, reg + expressCost); // need to consider transfer cost
            costs[i - 1] = Math.min(reg, exp);
        }
        return costs;
    }
```
