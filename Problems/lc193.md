# 193. Valid Phone Numbers (E)
Given a text file ``file.txt`` that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one-liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

# ``grep`` with Extended Regular Expressions
```bash
grep -E '^(\([0-9]{3}\) [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4})$|^([0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4})$' file.txt
```
Explanation:


- ``^``: start of a line (not just within a line, ex 112-122-2313 not 022121-112-2313)
- ``[0-9]``: regex expression to represent any digit between 0 and 9.
- ``\d``: any digit (Perl-flavoured regular expression); use the ``-P`` tag in GNU/Linux env
- ``{3}``: repeated exactly 3 times, {4} repeated 4 times ect, hence ``[0-9]{3}`` means three numbers from 0-9.
- ``$`` end of a line
- ``|``: or expression
- ``()``: used to group expressions
- ``\(`` or ``\)``: used for literal parentheses
