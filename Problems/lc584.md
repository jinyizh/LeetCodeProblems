# 584. Find Customer Referee (E)
Table: ``Customer``
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
```
Write an SQL query to report the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with ``id = 2``.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.
```
Input: 
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

## MySQL
```sql
SELECT name FROM customer WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```
MySQL uses three-valued logic -- ``TRUE``, ``FALSE`` and ``UNKNOWN``. Anything compared to ``NULL`` evaluates to the third value: ``UNKNOWN``. That “anything” includes ``NULL`` itself! That’s why MySQL provides the ``IS NULL`` and ``IS NOT NULL`` operators to specifically check for ``NULL``.

Thus, one more condition ``referee_id IS NULL`` should be added to the ``WHERE`` clause.
